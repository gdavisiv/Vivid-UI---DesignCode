//How to use their API : https://github.com/contentful/contentful.swift/
//Now that we're receving data, we going to use that data to fill our UI :
//create a completion handler, '@escaping([entry]) -> () so when the call is successful and we're reciving the data
//we don't want to print anymore and we want to send back the array that we are receiving so we can use
//that in the UI
func getArray(id: String, completion: @escaping([Entry]) -> ()) {
    //The EntryDecodable protocol allows you to define a mapping between your content
    //types and your Swift classes that entries will be serialized to.
    //Couse is simply the content model
    let query = Query.where(contentTypeId: id)
    
    //To make the API call use client which was configured above, entry is the content model from contentful
    //
    client.fetchArray(of: Entry.self, matching: query) { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let array):

                //kind of data you are recieving so add 'as! String'
